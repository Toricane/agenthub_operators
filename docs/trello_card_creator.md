# Summary
The `TrelloCardCreator` operator creates a card in a list using the Trello API with the specified content.

# Inputs
- `name`: A string containing the name of the card to be created.
- `description`: A string containing the description of the card to be created.
- `label_ids`: A list of strings representing the label IDs to optionally assign to the card.

# Parameters
- `list_id`: A string representing the ID of the list where the card will be created.

# Outputs
- `created_card`: A JSON string representing the created card object.

# Functionality
The `run_step` function is responsible for the main logic of the operator. It reads the list ID from the parameters, and the name, description, and label IDs from the inputs. It also retrieves the API key and token from the AI context. It then calls the `create_card` helper function with the necessary parameters to create the card.

The `create_card` function constructs and sends the payload for creating a card in the specified list using the Trello API. If the card creation is successful, the created card object is returned as a JSON string. If an error occurs during the process, the error message from the Trello API is logged and returned as the output.
